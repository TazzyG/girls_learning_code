        #Using Scratch

        Scratch is a great tool for teaching coding concepts, and building fun and creative digital games. If you aren’t familiar with the program: great news! There are tons of free, online resources to get you started. Here are a few that we think are awesome:

        * Scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#resources">Educator Resources</a> (especially the <a href="https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__0c1805349a6fe15c01c668d3f8acd971__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>)

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Collaborative Game Production! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our programs before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them which ones they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then - since we had so many people asking if boys could come too - we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located, and if they are gender-neutral). If you need to go to the washroom, please go with your parent/guaridan or another learner.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it.
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a break mid-way through, when you can eat any *peanut free* snacks you brought along, or just stretch your legs. Please clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

              <br>A: Bugs are errors in our game (e.g. crashing, spelling mistakes). Debugging is finding these errors and trying to solve them. We will be debugging as we code our games - it's part of the process! (also in post-production)</td>

                  <li>This started to become an issue in the late 1990s, beekeepers around the world have observed the mysterious and sudden disappearance of bees (& report unusually high rates of decline in honeybee colonies - the rusty patched bumblebee is now an endangered species)</li>
                  <li>Climate change specifics: drastic temperature changes, rainfall patterns</li>
                  <li>What is Biodiversity?: The variety of living things in the worlds - or a specific area/habitat</li>
                  <li>Parasites/disease specifics: Bees become more susceptible to disease- pesticide lowers their immune systems</li>
                  <li>A well-manicured lawn is like a desert to bees, and some have a more specific diet, so less biodiversity could mean being unable to survive</li>

              <br><br> Q: Why does a GDD need to be "living" or changing?
              <br>A: As we create our game, we might change our mind, have another idea we want to add in, or come across an issue that results in changing a part of our game. This is completely normal!</td>

            </tr><tr>
          </table>


        <br>
        #Stations

        * Tell the class that each group of tables will be a station
        * Show them the room layout diagram on Slide #22
        * Tell the class that the Artworks station will be creating graphics, and the Audio station will create sound effects and background music
        * Have the mentors assigned to each station stand up and wave - Tell the class that the mentors have a checklist with items to be created, and they will help assign each learner an item (or multiple, if they finish early)
        * Draw attention to the printed instructions provided at each station
        * Give learners a heads-up that you will be collecting their finished assets/audio on a USB before the break
        * Feel free to float around during the stations. The mentors will lead the stations, so you can take this time to interact with learners and parents 1-on-1.
        * <strong>Use the last 10 mintues to collect as many items as you can on the provided USB.</strong> Ask mentors or the Chapter Lead for help, if needed.

        ##During the Break

        Follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1JQA9qmeeMQNPgigtG7pkOaLyvDrIMe2xsQ0xYIHb0/edit?usp=sharing">these steps</a> to upload the files from the USB into the Scratch "Files" Studio.

        *If the internet is not working: Work with the Chapter Lead to copy all assets and audio into one folder, then copy onto several other USBs. Have mentors go around the class during the mini Code-Along in Scratch and copy the folder onto each learner's Desktop.*


        <br>
        #Gamebuilding

        * Use Slide #26 to show learners where to find the Files Studio, and how to download assets and audio ("save to local file")
        * Display the checklist on Slide #27 and give learners 5 minutes to save files to their computer
        * Quick Code-Along:
          * Open up Scratch on your computer
          * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
          * Demonstrate how to upload Sprites: Add the Hero and Collectible (that's it, for now!)
          * Demonstrate how to change the backdrop
          * Give learners 2 minutes to do the same on their computer
          * While they wait, learners can also click on blocks and test them out
        * Follow the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/116daYtZcZ_OsVc80g6xfr8azoDyKSvYiVFA5xQrrBAc/edit?usp=sharing">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in building a Catch Em Game.
        * *If learners get restless, you may want to include a 5min stretch break midway through*
        * Make sure everyone clicks on "SHARE" when they are finished (top, right corner) - See Slide #29
        * Have learners add their projects to the studio (Go to "My Class" > Select studio > Add Projects) - See Slide #30

        <br>
        #Beta Testing

        * Ask "What is Beta Testing?" *A: This is when someone other than the game developers play a game to test it out*
        * Tell the class that we are going to take a few minutes to beta test by playing a level created by someone else in the class
        * Use Slide #32 to show learners where to find all of our game levels
        * Give learners 5 minutes to play 1-2 levels in the studio
        * *While we won't have time to fix every bug, it is still valuable for us to get a taste of the process.*


        <br>
        #Game Release

        * Instruct everyone to wrap up what they are working on and close their laptops
        * Announce that we are releasing our completed game (Woo! Be excited!)
        * Have 2-3 volunteers come up to the front and DEMO their projects - Access levels via the Gamebuilding Studio
        * <strong>Reflection</strong>: Use Slide #35 to reflect on what we learned
        * Use Slide #36 to draw attention to anything that was missed


        <br>
        #Closing Script

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site girlslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!

        <strong>Gather the group for a team photo! </strong>

                <li>Climate change specifics: drastic temperature changes, rainfall patterns</li>
                <li>What is Biodiversity?: The variety of living things in the worlds - or a specific area/habitat</li>
                <li>Parasites/disease specifics: Bees become more susceptible to disease- pesticide lowers their immune systems</li>
                <li>A well-manicured lawn is like a desert to bees, and some have a more specific diet, so less biodiversity could mean being unable to survive</li>

            <br>A: As we create our game, we might change our mind, have another idea we want to add in, or come across an issue that results in changing a part of our game. This is completely normal!</td>

      #Stations

      * Tell the class that each group of tables will be a station
      * Show them the room layout diagram on Slide #22
      * Tell the class that the Artworks station will be creating graphics, and the Audio station will create sound effects and background music
      * Have the mentors assigned to each station stand up and wave - Tell the class that the mentors have a checklist with items to be created, and they will help assign each learner an item (or multiple, if they finish early)
      * Draw attention to the printed instructions provided at each station
      * Give learners a heads-up that you will be collecting their finished assets/audio on a USB before the break
      * Feel free to float around during the stations. The mentors will lead the stations, so you can take this time to interact with learners and parents 1-on-1.
      * <strong>Use the last 10 mintues to collect as many items as you can on the provided USB.</strong> Ask mentors or the Chapter Lead for help, if needed.

      ##During the Break

      Follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1JQA9qmeeMQNPgigtG7pkOaLyvDrIMe2xsQ0xYIHb0/edit?usp=sharing">these steps</a> to upload the files from the USB into the Scratch "Files" Studio.

      *If the internet is not working: Work with the Chapter Lead to copy all assets and audio into one folder, then copy onto several other USBs. Have mentors go around the class during the mini Code-Along in Scratch and copy the folder onto each learner's Desktop.*

      #Gamebuilding

      * Use Slide #26 to show learners where to find the Files Studio, and how to download assets and audio ("save to local file")
      * Display the checklist on Slide #27 and give learners 5 minutes to save files to their computer
      * Quick Code-Along:
        * Open up Scratch on your computer
        * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks
        * Demonstrate how to upload Sprites: Add the Hero and Collectible (that's it, for now!)
        * Demonstrate how to change the backdrop
        * Give learners 2 minutes to do the same on their computer
        * While they wait, learners can also click on blocks and test them out
      * Follow the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/116daYtZcZ_OsVc80g6xfr8azoDyKSvYiVFA5xQrrBAc/edit?usp=sharing">solution sheet</a></strong> as you lead the group in building a Catch Em Game.
      * *If learners get restless, you may want to include a 5min stretch break midway through*
      * Make sure everyone clicks on "SHARE" when they are finished (top, right corner) - See Slide #29
      * Have learners add their projects to the studio (Go to "My Class" > Select studio > Add Projects) - See Slide #30

      * Tell the class that we are going to take a few minutes to beta test by playing a level created by someone else in the class
      * Use Slide #32 to show learners where to find all of our game levels
      * Give learners 5 minutes to play 1-2 levels in the studio
      * *While we won't have time to fix every bug, it is still valuable for us to get a taste of the process.*
